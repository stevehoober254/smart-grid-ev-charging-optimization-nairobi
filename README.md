## Overview

This project aims to develop a data-driven pipeline to identify optimal locations for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations within Nairobi, Kenya. The optimization considers both urban characteristics (population density, points of interest, traffic proxies) to maximize user accessibility and potential impact on the existing electricity grid to minimize strain. This initiative seeks to provide actionable insights for urban planners, energy providers, and investors in the burgeoning Kenyan e-mobility sector.

## Problem Statement

The rapid growth of EV adoption in Nairobi necessitates a strategic deployment of charging infrastructure. This project addresses the challenge of determining the most suitable locations for new charging stations by analyzing urban data and considering the potential load on the power grid, thereby enhancing user convenience and ensuring grid stability.

## Project Goals

1.  **Acquire and Integrate Diverse Data:** Collect and combine urban datasets (population density, points of interest, traffic proxies) and simulated/representative grid information for Nairobi.
2.  **Develop a Location Scoring Mechanism:** Create a methodology to score potential charging station locations based on accessibility and grid impact.
3.  **Visualize Optimal Locations:** Present the identified optimal locations on an interactive map of Nairobi.
4.  **Document the End-to-End Pipeline:** Clearly document the data acquisition, processing, modeling, and visualization steps.

## Technical Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Data Processing & Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy, GeoPandas
* **Geospatial Analysis:** GeoPandas, potentially Shapely
* **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, potentially Plotly/Folium for interactive maps
* **Data Storage (Potential):** CSV files, potentially PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
* **Version Control:** Git

## Data Sources (Planned)

* **Urban Data:**
    * Population density data (e.g., from census reports or publicly available aggregated data).
    * Points of Interest (POIs) data (e.g., OpenStreetMap).
    * Traffic flow proxies (e.g., major road networks from OpenStreetMap).
* **Simulated/Representative Grid Data:**
    * Assumptions about grid capacity in different areas of Nairobi (based on general knowledge of infrastructure or publicly available high-level information).
    * Potentially data on the location of power substations.

## Project Pipeline

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Downloading or accessing the necessary urban and grid-related datasets.
2.  **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handling missing data, transforming data into usable formats, and ensuring data consistency.
3.  **Feature Engineering:** Creating relevant features such as density metrics, proximity to POIs, and potential grid load indicators.
4.  **Location Scoring/Optimization:** Implementing the scoring mechanism or a simple optimization algorithm to evaluate potential locations.
5.  **Visualization:** Generating maps and other visualizations to highlight the recommended charging station locations.
6.  **Documentation:** Providing clear explanations of each step, the data used, and the code implementation.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd smart-grid-ev-charging-optimization-nairobi
    ```
2.  **Set up the environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *(Note: The `requirements.txt` file will be created as the project progresses.)*
